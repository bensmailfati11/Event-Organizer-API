# 🎉 Event Organizer API

A simple REST API to **create, manage, and attend events** — with **authentication**, **role-based permissions**.

## 🌟 Handlebars Branch Features

This branch includes **server-side rendering (SSR)** with Handlebars templating engine, providing a complete web interface alongside the REST API:

### ✨ Web Interface Features

- **Home Page**: Welcome page with user authentication status
- **Authentication**: Login and registration forms with session management
- **Events Page**: Browse all published events with registration options
- **Dashboard**: User dashboard for organizers to manage events and view registrations
- **API Documentation**: Interactive backend info page with endpoint details

### 🛠️ Technical Implementation

- **Handlebars Views**: Server-side rendered templates for dynamic content
- **Session Management**: Cookie-based authentication for web sessions
- **Responsive Design**: Bootstrap 5 for mobile-friendly UI
- **Form Handling**: POST requests for login, registration, and event creation
- **Role-Based UI**: Different features based on user roles (Member/Organizer)

### 📁 New Files Added

- `src/views/`: Handlebars template files
  - `home.handlebars`: Landing page
  - `auth.handlebars`: Login/register forms
  - `events.handlebars`: Events listing
  - `dashboard.handlebars`: User dashboard
  - `backend-info.handlebars`: API documentation
  - `layouts/main.handlebars`: Base layout template
- `src/routes/routes.js`: Web routes for SSR pages
- Updated `src/main.js`: Handlebars engine setup and web routes integration

## 🧭 API Endpoints

### Authentication

**Register**

```http
POST /auth/register
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "name": "John Doe",
  "email": "john@example.com",
  "password": "password123",
  "role": "member"
}
```

**Login**

```http
POST /auth/login
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "email": "john@example.com",
  "password": "password123"
}
```

---

### Events

**Get all events**

```http
GET /events
```

**Get event by ID**

```http
GET /events/:id
```

**Create event (Organizer/Admin)**

```http
POST /events
Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "title": "Tech Meetup",
  "description": "A meetup for tech enthusiasts",
  "date": "2025-12-15T18:00:00Z",
  "location": "Paris",
  "capacity": 50,
  "status": "published"
}
```

**Update event (Owner/Admin)**

```http
PUT /events/:id
Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "title": "Updated Tech Meetup",
  "capacity": 100
}
```

**Delete event (Owner/Admin)**

```http
DELETE /events/:id
Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN
```

**Register for event (Member)**

```http
POST /events/:id/register
Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN
```

**Unregister from event (Member)**

```http
DELETE /events/:id/register
Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN
```

## 🧪 Testing (REST Client)

1. Open `rest/auth.rest` → run **register** & **login** requests.
2. Copy the `token` from login response:

```json
{
  "user": {...},
  "token": "eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIs..."
}
```

3. Paste token at the top of `rest/events.rest`:

```
@org_token = eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIs...
@member_token = ...
@admin_token = ...
```

4. Create an event → copy `_id` → set:

```
@event_id = your_event_id
```

5. Run all other requests (update, delete, register, unregister).

> `.rest` files are ignored by Git to protect your tokens.

## 🧰 Tech Stack

- Node.js (ES Modules)
- Express.js
- MongoDB + Mongoose
- JWT Authentication
- bcryptjs (password hashing)

---

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting

**MongoDB not connecting**

```bash
# Windows
net start MongoDB
# macOS / Linux
sudo systemctl start mongod
```

**Invalid token** → copy full token from login response without quotes.
**Event not found** → create event first, copy `_id` into `@event_id`.
**Port 3001 already in use** → change `.env` PORT or kill process.

---

## 🔒 Security

- Never commit `.env` or `.rest` files
- Use a strong `JWT_SECRET` in production
- Tokens expire after 24h — log in again to refresh
